module Cardlogic


let foo number = number * number





(*Need minimum 3 scenes:
- Startup (menu)
- Running (actualy gameplay)
- Game over

But we could add many many more scenes than that. We might need more.

Focus on the actual gameplay. Make a simple gameplay loop. It will
be a lot easier to scale later on.


Start with a state machine.
